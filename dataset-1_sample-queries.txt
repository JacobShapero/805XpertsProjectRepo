All SPL queries should be preceded by a source location and a host. For my local usage of Splunk these were:

source="C:\\Users\\jwsha\\Desktop\\dataset-1.json\\*" host="DESKTOP-NTLJAJL"

Task: Identify different types of uri found in this dataset.
SPL: | stats values(result.uri) as unique_uris

Task: Count number of times each uri has been called in this dataset.
SPL: | stats count by result.uri

Task: Identify different kinds of applicationName.
SPL: | stats values(result.applicationName) as unique_applicationNames

Task: Identify total number of unique devices.
SPL: | stats dc(result.bodyId) as total_unique_devices

Task: Identify total number of unique contents.
SPL: | rex field=result.payload "contentId=(?<contentId>\d+)"
| stats dc(contentId) as total_unique_contents

Task: Identify top (10) devices with most number of activity.
SPL: | stats sum(result.totalRecordingCounts) as totalRecordings by result.bodyId
| sort -totalRecordings
| head 10

Task: Identify patterns in time period of a day OR days in a week, where these devices are most active.
SPL: [ search source="C:\\Users\\jwsha\\Desktop\\dataset-1.json\\*" host="DESKTOP-NTLJAJL" 
  | stats count by result.bodyId
  | sort -count
  | head 10
  | fields result.bodyId
]
| eval hourOfDay=strftime(_time, "%H"), dayOfWeek=strftime(_time, "%A")
| stats count by result.bodyId, hourOfDay, dayOfWeek
| sort -count

Task: Identify top devices with most number of npvrOfferCaptureSearch.
SPL: result.uri="/npvrOfferCaptureSearch"
| stats count by result.bodyId
| sort -count
| head 10

Task: Identify most expensive apis in terms of duration durationNS.
SPL: | stats sum(result.durationNS) as totalDuration by result.uri
| sort -totalDuration
| head 10

Task: Identify top devices based in recording counts.
SPL: | stats sum(result.totalRecordingCounts) as totalRecordings by result.bodyId
| sort -totalRecordings
| head 10
